# ML/DL Course Projects

This is my repository for projects completed as part of my Tensorflow for Deep Learning Bootcamp. In these projects, I explored key ML/DL concepts and applied them to real-world datasets.

## Overview

This repository includes a variety of projects that demonstrate essential ML/DL techniques, including:

**Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, or segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, or sequence modeling using recurrent and transformer-based models.

**Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting trends and analyzing time-dependent data using LSTMs and other sequence models.

## Technologies Used

Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder containing:

Jupyter Notebooks: The main codebase with explanations and results.

Datasets: Sample datasets used for training and testing.

Reports & Documentation: Descriptions, methodologies, pseudocode, and performance analysis.

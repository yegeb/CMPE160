# CMPE160 Course Projects

This is my repository for projects completed as part of the **CMPE160**. In this course, I learned the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming along with essential data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

This repository includes a variety of projects that demonstrate key concepts such as:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, analyzing UML Diagrams etc.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Implementation and use of basic data structures (arrays, lists, trees, etc.) and algorithms such as Dijkstra and Ant Colony Optimization.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder containing:
- **Source Code:** The main codebase for the project.
- **Documentation:** A description file with setup instructions and project details. Also pseudocodes and results provided in a report file.
- **Testcases:** Sample test cases or scripts to validate functionality.
